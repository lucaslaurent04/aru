## Purpose

The repository is a PHP web server for handling backups of B2 private cloud instances.

It is designed to be used in conjunction with the [B2 repository](https://github.com/yesbabylon/b2) for initializing
instances using the eQual framework.

## Features

- **Backup**: The repository provides a PHP web server for handling backups of B2 private cloud instances.
- **Automation**: The server automatically handles the backup process, ensuring that your data is secure and accessible.
- **Security**: The server is designed to be secure, with encryption and authentication mechanisms in place to protect
  your data.
- **Monitoring**: The server provides monitoring tools to track the status of backups and ensure that they are running
  smoothly.

## Important Note

## Installation

To install the host backup server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository in ``/root`` of your server.
2. execute the `install.sh` script to set up the server and the ``host-backup`` service.

The script listens for incoming requests from the B2 private cloud instances and initiates the backup process.

```bash
curl -X POST http://<host-backup-server-ip>:8000/<your-desired-route>
```
